# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds Orbit's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): short documents that
capture an architecturally significant decision, its context, and its consequences.

## Conventions

- Files are named `NNNN-short-title.md` with a zero-padded, monotonically increasing number.
- Every ADR uses [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md) and contains: **Title · Status · Date ·
  Context · Decision · Consequences · Alternatives Considered**.
- **Status** is one of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Superseded by NNNN`.
- Decisions are **append-only**: to reverse one, add a new ADR that supersedes it and set the
  old ADR's status to `Superseded by NNNN`. Never rewrite a past decision's history.
- Write an ADR for architecturally significant choices (structure, data flow, external
  interfaces, cross-cutting concerns, security, deployment, scope). Skip ADRs for tiny,
  low-risk, easily reversible, or already-covered decisions. See `CLAUDE.md` →
  "Documentation standards" for the full rule.
