# Orbit — Portfolio Risk Intelligence

> A portfolio risk intelligence platform that helps individual investors understand what they actually hold and what could hurt them. It combines a quantitative **Risk & Exposure engine** (the core) with an evidence-grounded **document-intelligence / RAG layer** (secondary) that explains risk using primary financial filings.

**Status:** Active development · Academic capstone (Penn State MSE, SWENG 894) · Solo project
**Product name:** Orbit · **Working scope:** MVP over 14 weeks (4 sprints)

## 1. Context for AI agents / new contributors

This section exists so a fresh session (human or AI) has **zero context loss**. Read it fully before making changes.

- **What this is:** A capstone software product, not a research notebook. It is a real, deployable application with proper architecture, tests, and CI/CD — not just a model in a Jupyter notebook. Software-engineering rigor is mandatory.
- **What it is NOT:** It does **not** predict prices, execute trades, or give personalized investment advice. It **measures, contextualizes, and explains risk**. Any framing like "beat the market" is out of scope and off-thesis. The value is in analysis, risk, and grounded explanation.
- **Who it's for:** The self-directed individual investor holding stocks and ETFs who wants clearer, evidence-based risk insight than mainstream retail tools provide.
- **Core differentiator:** Fusing quantitative risk metrics with *evidence-grounded* explanations — every explanation cites the specific filing passage it came from. Competitors (e.g. Barebone AI, Magnifi) do one side or the other, shallowly; the integration is the edge.
- **Data:** All data is free/public and used for research/academic purposes only (no redistribution rights assumed). Sources: a free market-data API (prices), SEC EDGAR (filings), a hosted LLM API (RAG). Data is cached locally to respect free-tier rate limits.
- **Constraint that shapes everything:** Solo developer, fixed 14-week timeline. Scope is deliberately staged (core → secondary → stretch). When in doubt, protect the core; defer the rest to the backlog.

### Scope tiers (do not blur these)

| Tier | What | Build priority |
|---|---|---|
| **Core (committed)** | Portfolio ingestion + Risk & Exposure engine (volatility, correlation, concentration/exposure, drawdown, stress testing) | The significant algorithmic component; primary focus |
| **Secondary (in scope, after core is stable)** | Document intelligence / RAG over SEC filings with grounded, cited explanations | Built once the core is stable |
| **Stretch (backlog, only if core finishes early)** | Regime detection, anomaly detection, automated brokerage connection (Plaid/SnapTrade) | Not committed; un-pointed until core lands |

Per instructor guidance: the **Risk & Exposure engine is the core**; RAG is a **secondary** feature; the three stretch items are deferred.

## 2. Architecture

Layered, component-based, fully containerized. Everything inside the deployment boundary runs as Docker Compose services; external data sources and CI/CD sit outside it. The analytical engines are decoupled behind the API so the core can be built/tested/demoed independently and new engines plug in without modifying it.

```

### Component responsibilities

- **React + TypeScript frontend** — presentation only (portfolio entry, risk dashboard + visualizations, natural-language Q&A). No business logic; talks to the backend over REST.
- **FastAPI backend (API layer)** — single entry point/orchestrator: authentication, routing, input validation, engine invocation. Exposes engines **only** through the API contract; the frontend never touches engine internals.
- **Risk & Exposure engine (core)** — the significant algorithmic component: volatility, correlation structure, concentration/exposure, drawdown, stress testing. Consumes cached market data. No knowledge of the frontend or RAG engine.
- **RAG engine (secondary)** — isolated document intelligence: retrieves SEC filings, embeds/indexes them, produces grounded, cited explanations. Kept separate so the core stays stable.
- **Data layer** — PostgreSQL + pgvector. Relational data (portfolios, holdings, cached prices) and vector embeddings live in one service to reduce moving parts.
- **External services** — free market-data API, SEC EDGAR, hosted LLM API. Reached only through the backend; credentials and rate-limited calls stay server-side.
- **Docker Compose + GitHub Actions** — Compose orchestrates internal services; Actions builds/tests container images on every push and deploys the same images.

### Quality attributes the architecture targets

- **Maintainability / Modifiability** — decoupled engines behind an API contract; new engines added without touching the core.
- **Portability** — full containerization, provider-agnostic; no cloud vendor lock-in.
- **Security** — auth gates portfolio access; all external calls/credentials are server-side.
- **Performance / Scalability** — market-data caching avoids redundant calls and respects free-tier limits; stateless API can scale horizontally.

## 3. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend / ML / RAG | **Python 3.12**, FastAPI | pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for risk math; LLM/embedding client + filings parser for RAG |
| Frontend | **TypeScript**, React | Axios for HTTP; risk dashboard + Q&A UI |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector** | Relational data + vector embeddings in one service |
| Containerization | **Docker + Docker Compose** | Provider-agnostic deployment; the deployment backbone |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** | Build + test containers on every push |
| Testing | **pytest** (backend), **Vitest + React Testing Library** (frontend), **Postman** (API/integration) | Runs in CI |
| LLM (RAG) | **Hosted LLM API** | Abstracted behind an interface so the provider can be swapped |
| Deployment | Container host (provider-agnostic) | The containerized stack runs on any container-friendly host |

Guiding principles: provider-agnostic + container-based (no lock-in), open-source where practical, decoupled architecture, free/public data only.

## 4. Repository layout (planned)

> This is the intended structure; it will fill in as sprints progress. Keep the frontend/backend decoupled and the engines isolated behind the API.

Goal: a running, deployable app that ingests a portfolio and shows a real risk metric on live market data (thin end-to-end slice).
- US-14 Containerized deployment skeleton (5)
- US-15 Decoupled engine behind API (3)
- US-1 Add holding manually (2)
- US-3 Manage holdings (2)
- US-4 Retrieve + cache market data (5)
- US-5 Volatility (holding + portfolio) (3)

### Sprint 2 (Wks 6–8) — full risk core + dashboard → **Product Demo I** · 21 pts

## 7. Conventions

Saved design reference: [Orbi mascot prototype and integration handoff](docs/design/orbi/README.md)
(design only; not yet integrated into the application).

Current academic sprint evidence: [Sprint 1 backlog and Definition of Done](docs/sprint1-plan.md)
(working artifact for Weeks 3-5; it does not replace the submitted Week 2 report).

[Sprint 1 acceptance test specifications](docs/sprint1-tests.md) record the
September 8 evidence snapshot. The Sprint 2 subtotal was corrected from
18 to 21 on September 8 (arithmetic only; no story estimates or assignments changed).
The estimated Sprint 1-3 baseline totals 62 points, excluding unestimated additions.

- **Branching:** feature branches → PR → CI must pass → merge to `main`.
- **Issues:** each user story is an issue, labeled by tier (`core`, `secondary`, `stretch`, `architectural`) and sprint; tracked on the GitHub Project board.
- **Engines stay decoupled:** the frontend and other engines call the risk engine **only** through the API contract, never internal code.
- **Data hygiene:** never commit API keys; external services are configured via environment variables. Cache external data locally.
- **Testing:** new backend logic ships with pytest coverage; API endpoints validated (Postman/integration) and run in CI.
- **Scope discipline:** protect the core; new feature ideas go to the backlog as stretch, not into the current sprint.
