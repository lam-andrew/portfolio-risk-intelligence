            The square root matters. <em>Variance</em> scales linearly with time, and volatility is
            the square root of variance — so 25 days of returns have 25× the variance but only √25 =
            5× the standard deviation. A holding with a 1% daily standard deviation is reported at
            roughly 15.9% annualized. Multiplying by 252 instead would overstate risk about
            sixteenfold.

          returns are independent of each other. Real markets show volatility clustering — turbulent

            Baseline and loss round half-up to cents per holding before totals are summed. The
            displayed loss percentage uses those rounded totals. One usable price per holding is
            enough: no volatility estimate is fitted, so the 20-return statistical minimum does not
            apply. Missing prices or no common date means no estimate, never a partial total.

          These are equal price shocks, not historical crisis replays or forecasts. Bonds and ETFs
          receive the same shock as stocks; diversification, sector sensitivity, fees, taxes and
          currency changes are not modeled. Adjusted closes are an analytical baseline, not live
          quotes, and cached prices may be stale. The overview may use newer individual dates; the
          stress screen shows its common pricing date.

            Each metric is implemented correctly against its own definition. Whether those
            definitions are <em>sufficient</em> for your decisions is a separate question, and
            answering it means knowing what the analysis leaves out.
